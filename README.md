# LAZY ADMIN

## DISCLAIMER
I have compiled these settings and developed this script in my free time and with my limited knowledge, first and foremost to make my life easier. I am sharing it because you may also find it useful, but by no means consider it another 'hardening' or 'debloating' tool. There are others surely more updated, tweakable, better documented and better coded.

Please that your time to read learn about the security and privacy features of Windows. Understand what is the purpose of this script and that if the settings here applied were a one-size-fits-all, they would likely be already enabled by default.

Also note that the script might be flagged as a virus due to the code it uses to request administrator priviledges.

In any case, I shall not be responsible if any issue occurs.

## PURPOSE
To get a more secure and private Windows environment while retaining its core usability.

## NOT A PURPOSE
To get either the most security or privacy possible from a Windows environment.

## TO WHOM IT AIMS
People who want to streamline their deployments and who are willing to look at the code and their source documentation if needed.

## TO WHOM IT SHOULD NOT AIM
To basically everyone else.

## CONTRIBUTING
Please take a look at the respective document.
